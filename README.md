# movie-recommendation-system-using-
This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests films based on user input. It processes a dataset of movies by combining features like genres, keywords, and cast, and uses TF-IDF for vectorization and cosine similarity for analysis. Users enter a movie name, and the system recommends up to 10 similar titles.
